# About {.unnumbered}

This book is a quick-reference guide for data science, machine learning, and related topics. It’s written for students and working professionals who want a practical summary of key ideas, workflows, and tools.

This guide focuses on quick definitions, examples, short reminders, and curated links. It’s meant to be used when:

- You’ve already learned a concept and need a quick refresher.
- You’re working on a project and want to check best practices.
- You forgot which metrics apply to a specific ML task.
- You want a shortcut to useful external resources.

This guide is a work in progress and will grow over time as I add new topics and improve existing ones.

The field is wide, and no two data scientists use the exact same approach or tools. This guide reflects a generalist perspective, based on real-world use cases and common patterns.
