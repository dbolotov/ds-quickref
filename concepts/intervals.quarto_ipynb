        "Machine learning models typically return point predictions, not uncertainty estimates. However, intervals are useful when presenting results or identifying low-confidence cases. Here we discuss two types of intervals:\n",

        "- **Confidence interval**: uncertainty in the estimated mean response for a given input. Range of likely values for the *average prediction* at a given input.\n",
        "- **Prediction interval**: range for the actual observed value, which includes both model uncertainty and natural variability (Note: \"observed value\" refers to the real-world outcome that would come from data, not the model's predicted value).\n",
        "\n",
        "These intervals are common in statistical modeling and in time series forecasting, but less so in machine learning because many ML models don’t compute them directly. One workaround is **bootstrapping**, where multiple models are fit on resampled training data, and the spread of predictions is used to estimate uncertainty. In this case, intervals are estimated empirically rather than derived analytically.\n",
