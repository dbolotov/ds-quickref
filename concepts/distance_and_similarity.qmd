This page is a quick reference for common distance and similarity measures used in machine learning, clustering, and data matching. Each entry includes a brief description, supported data types, and links to Wikipedia articles and Python implementation. This list is not exhaustive.

## Measures explained

Distance and similarity quantify how alike or different two objects are. These measures are often used in:

- Clustering algorithms (e.g. K-Means, DBSCAN)
- Nearest neighbor search (e.g. KNN)
- Deduplication or record linkage
- String comparison and vector similarity

A **distance** increases as objects differ more. A **similarity** increases as objects become more alike.

## Related terms

- **Metric**: A distance function that satisfies properties like non-negativity and triangle inequality.  
- **Dissimilarity**: Often used interchangeably with distance; not always a proper metric.  
- **Similarity**: Higher values mean greater closeness or match; may not have fixed bounds.

Sensitive to scale. |
| [Gower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gower%27s_distance) | mixed | [gower](https://pypi.org/project/gower/) | Handles mixed data types by averaging scaled feature-wise dissimilarities. |

Works on binary vectors and strings of equal length. |
| [Levenshtein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) | string | [textdistance](https://github.com/life4/textdistance) | Edit distance that counts insertions, deletions, and substitutions. Strings can be different lengths. |
| [Mahalanobis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahalanobis_distance) | num | [skl](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.DistanceMetric.html), [scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.distance.mahalanobis.html) | Accounts for correlation and scale among variables. Useful for multivariate data. |
| [Manhattan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry) | num | [skl](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.DistanceMetric.html), [scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.distance.cityblock.html) | Sum of absolute differences (L1 norm). Also called city-block distance. |
| [Squared Euclidean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance#Squared_Euclidean_distance) | num | [skl](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.DistanceMetric.html), [scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.distance.sqeuclidean.html) | Same as Euclidean but without the square root. Useful for comparing relative closeness, especially in K-Means. |

| Name | Data | Python | Description |
|------|------|--------|-------------|
| [Cosine Similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) | num | [skl](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.pairwise.cosine_similarity.html), [scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.distance.cosine.html) | Measures angle (not magnitude) between vectors. Common for text embeddings. |
| [Dice Coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sørensen–Dice_coefficient) | bool, cat, string | [skl](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.DistanceMetric.html) | Similar to Jaccard but gives more weight to matches. Used in fuzzy matching and bioinformatics. |
| [Jaccard Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index) | bool, cat | [skl](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.DistanceMetric.html), [scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.distance.jaccard.html) | Ratio of intersection to union. Used for comparing binary vectors or sets. |
| [Simple Matching Coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_matching_coefficient) | bool, cat, string | [kmodes](https://github.com/nicodv/kmodes) | Proportion of element-wise matches between two equal-length vectors. Treats 0-0 and 1-1 matches equally. Can be used with binary, categorical, or string data when comparing character by character. |
