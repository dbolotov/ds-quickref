# Workflows Index {.unnumbered}

This section contains end-to-end Jupyter Notebook templates for common data science tasks. Each example uses a built-in dataset and goes through steps like loading and transforming the data, creating models (in `scikit-learn`, `darts`, or other packages), and evaluating results.

| Workflow | Description |
