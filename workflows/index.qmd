# Workflows Index {.unnumbered}

This section contains end-to-end Jupyter Notebook templates for common data science tasks. Each example uses a built-in dataset and goes through steps like loading and transforming the data, creating models (in `scikit-learn`, `darts`, or other packages), and evaluating results.

| Workflow | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [End-to-End Data Science Project](ds_workflow.qmd) | Basic workflow and tools for developing and sharing data science projects. |
| [Forecasting with Univariate Time Series](forecasting_multi_univariate.ipynb) | Training several forecasting models with the `darts` package on the sea ice dataset. |
| [Classification with Tabular Data](classification_tabular.ipynb) | Training a random forest classifier with `scikit-learn` on the Palmer penguins dataset. |
| [Regression with Tabular Data](regression_tabular.ipynb) | Training several regression models with `scikit-learn` on the tips dataset. |
